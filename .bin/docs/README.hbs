# cwlogs-writable #

Writable stream for AWS CloudWatch Logs

## Features ##

* Uses [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk).
* Can be used anywhere Writable streams are allowed.
* Allows for recovery from AWS errors.
* Creates log groups and streams if they do not exist.
* Filtering of log events by the stream itself.

## API Docs ##

There are two forms of the API docs:

* [Normal API docs](docs/api.md) - Use this if you using cwlogs-writable
  as-is and not customizing/extending it's functionality.
* [Extended API docs](docs/api-protected.md) - Use this to also view
  `protected` methods that you can use to customize/extend cwlogs-writable.

## Quick Start ##

Install the library using NPM into your existing node project:

```
npm install cwlogs-writable
```

Create and write to the stream.

```javascript
var CWLogsWritable = require('cwlogs-writable');

var stream = new CWLogsWritable({
  logGroupName: 'my-aws-log-group',
  logStreamName: 'my-log-stream',

  // Options passed to the AWS.CloudWatchLogs service.
  cloudWatchLogsOptions: {
    // Change the AWS region as needed.
    region: 'us-east-1',

    // Example authenticating using access key.
    accessKeyId: '{AWS-IAM-USER-ACCESS-KEY-ID}',
    secretAccessKey: '{AWS-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY}'
  }
});

stream.write('example-log-message');
```

## Bunyan Example ##

```javascript
var bunyan = require('bunyan');
var CWLogsWritable = require('cwlogs-writable');

var logger = bunyan.createLogger({
  name: 'foo',
  streams: [
    {
      level: 'debug',

      // If 'raw' the CloudWatch log event timestamp will
      // be taken from the bunyan JSON (i.e. rec.time).
      type: 'raw',

      stream: new CWLogsWritable({
        logGroupName: 'my-aws-log-group',
        logStreamName: 'my-log-stream',
        cloudWatchLogsOptions: { /* ... */ }
      })
    }
  ]
});
```

## Recovering from AWS Errors ##

When an AWS error is encounted, the default behavior of a CWLogsWritable
stream is to emit an 'error' event, clear any queued logs, and ignore all
further writes to the stream to prevent memory leaks.

To override this behavior you can provide a `onError` callback that will
allow you to recover from these errors.

```javascript
var CWLogsWritable = require('cwlogs-writable');

function onError(err, logEvents, next) {
  // Use built-in behavior if the error is not
  // from a PutLogEvents action (logEvents will be null).
  if (!logEvents) {
    next(err);
    return;
  }

  // Requeue the log events after a delay,
  // if the queue is small enough.
  if (this.getQueueSize() < 100) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      // Pass the logEvents to the "next" callback
      // so they are added back to the head of the queue.
      next(logEvents);
    }, 2000);
  }

  // Otherwise, log the events to the console
  // and resume streaming.
  else {
    console.error(
      'Failed to send logEvents: ' +
      JSON.stringify(logEvents)
    );

    next();
  }
}

var stream = new CWLogsWritable({
  logGroupName: 'my-aws-log-group',
  logStreamName: 'my-log-stream',
  cloudWatchLogsOptions: { /* ... */ },

  // Pass the onError callback to CWLogsWritable
  onError: onError
});
```
